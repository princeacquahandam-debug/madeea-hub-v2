-- One-off operational script, NOT a schema migration — do not add it to the
-- migration runner (it seeds invite rows, it doesn't change structure).
--
-- Preferred path is still the app's Admin panel "Invite by email", which does
-- BOTH steps below in one call via the invite-member Edge Function. Use this file
-- only if the Admin panel or its email delivery isn't working and you're driving
-- it from the Supabase dashboard by hand.
--
-- TWO STEPS ARE REQUIRED — the SQL below is only step 1:
--
--   1. (this file) Pre-authorize the addresses in `invites`. handle_new_user reads
--      this row to decide membership; without it a signup gets NO seat (see 0016).
--   2. Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> Users -> "Invite user", once per
--      address. THIS is what creates the account and actually sends the email.
--
-- Run step 1 BEFORE step 2: since migration 0020, membership is granted when the
-- address is CONFIRMED (the invitee clicks the email link), and the confirm-time
-- trigger reads `invites` at that moment. If the row isn't there yet, they land
-- with no workspace.
--
-- Idempotent: `on conflict (email) do nothing` means re-running won't clobber an
-- invite that's already been accepted (which is what keeps an existing member in
-- the workspace).
