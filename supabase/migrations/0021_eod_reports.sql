-- 0021_eod_reports.sql — End-of-day reports + task blockers.
--
-- Consolidated from a feature branch that was cut against an OLDER checkout. That
-- branch shipped three migrations (0013_task_history_and_snoozes, 0016_eod,
-- 0019_one_identity_per_account); on THIS repo they were partly redundant and
-- partly harmful, so only the genuinely-new EOD schema is kept here:
--
--   * DROPPED entirely: the branch's 0013. Its columns (updated_at/completed_at/
--     assignee_id), task_events, snoozes, and their triggers already exist here
--     via 0013_followups / 0014_activity_log / 0015_delegation. Re-applying it
--     would have added a SECOND reassignment trigger (duplicate task_events rows)
--     and, worse, re-created a `for all` write policy on task_events — undoing the
--     audit-trail lockdown 0020 just applied.
--   * DROPPED: the branch 0016's re-declare of the completed_at stamping trigger —
--     0014 already stamps completed_at (tasks_touch_completed_at).
--   * KEPT (below): task blocker columns, the eod_reports table + RLS, and the
--     one-identity canonical-name trigger.
--
-- Uses my_workspace() / is_admin() (0003) and the workspace-shared RLS pattern.
-- Idempotent throughout; the frontend degrades gracefully if this isn't applied
-- (the EOD page falls back to its imported July history and hides the submit box).

-- profile on every write instead; the client's value is only a fallback.
