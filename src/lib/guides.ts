      "Pick a message and the panel shows what the draft will know — the client's tone, the thread so far, and what you owe them.",
      "It also knows whether you're late, and adjusts the opening: no mention when you're on time, a real apology when you've breached.",
      "“What should this do?” changes the whole email — declining reads nothing like chasing.",

    title: "How the Memory Helper works",
    points: [
      "A curated memory: nothing is remembered unless you write it here.",
      "Recall matches keywords and client, not meaning — “doesn't like early calls” won't be found by searching “scheduling”.",
      "Entries against a client flow into that client's email drafts automatically, and never into anyone else's.",

    title: "How the Decision Helper works",
    points: [
      "You set the options, the criteria and the weights — those are judgements and they stay yours.",
      "The app only multiplies and sorts. The scoring is visible and editable, never a black box.",
      "“What would change the answer” is the useful bit: it shows how fragile the ranking is.",
      "When two options are within 5 points it says the numbers don't decide it — and the AI writes a record, never a recommendation.",

    title: "How the Homework Helper works",

      "Everything you owe before a fixed deadline — built from meetings with a start time and tasks with a due date.",
      "Different from Follow-ups: that's work that went quiet, this is work not started yet.",
      "“Brief me” writes a short 'where to start' summary from the list, nothing more.",
      "A meeting or task with no date on it produces nothing here — it isn't guessed at.",

    title: "How the Investor-Update Helper works",
    points: [
      "The right panel shows every fact the draft is allowed to use — read it before you generate.",
      "The app can't see your finances, so type headline metrics yourself; blanks are omitted, never invented.",
      "Risks and blockers are pulled from your data and included by default — an update with no lowlights reads as evasive.",
      "The draft is a starting point. Check every figure before it leaves your outbox.",
    ],
  },
  "/scoreboard": {
    title: "How the Scoreboard Helper works",
    points: [
      "Real performance over a period, compared against the period before it.",
      "“—” means no data, not zero. A missing average is never shown as 0h.",
      "Point-in-time numbers (open, overdue, waiting) show no comparison — last week's backlog can't be reconstructed.",
      "Read the amber caveat box first; it says what the numbers can't see.",

  "/travel": {
    title: "How the Travel Helper works",
    points: [
      "Enter each flight with its local times and both timezones — durations, layovers and clock changes are calculated for you.",
      "Warnings flag impossible connections, tight layovers, late arrivals and passports inside the six-month rule.",
      "“Add all to Tasks” turns the checklist into real tasks with due dates counted back from departure.",
      "The AI writes the document but does no maths — it copies the calculated times exactly.",
    ],
