      "Mark a task blocked with a reason on the board — it flags there and rolls into your EOD by itself.",

      "Every form field across the app now has a proper label for screen readers, and the timezone warning on the Travel Helper is announced with its field.",
      "Saving in the Memory Helper is now reliable — if a save is refused it tells you and keeps what you typed, instead of quietly losing it.",
