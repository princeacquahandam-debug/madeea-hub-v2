/**
 * Turns Kanban activity into a draft end-of-day report.
 *
 * The mapping the team asked for:
 *   Done      <- your tasks stamped completed_at today (migration 0014)
 *   Blockers  <- your tasks flagged blocked, with their reason (migration 0016)
 *   Plan      <- your tasks that aren't done and aren't blocked
 *
 * This only ever produces a DRAFT. The person edits it and submits, because an
 * EOD carries things the board never will ("attended the Monday meeting") and
 * because compliance only means something if submitting is a deliberate act.
